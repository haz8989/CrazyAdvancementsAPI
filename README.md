# CrazyAdvancementsAPI

This is my fork of CrazyAdvancementsAPI<br>
I've just cleaned up the project a little bit see commit: [Update Project](https://github.com/haz8989/CrazyAdvancementsAPI/commit/47fc3fc02bbccfb561d7defc7df213ff0740fc70)

You can get a build from the releases section https://github.com/haz8989/CrazyAdvancementsAPI/releases/tag/1.15

Because I've fixed the project structure you can get a build from jitpack repository:
